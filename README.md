# House Marketplace

This is a Marketplace with frontend powered by React and the backend by Firebase firestore.

## Usage

### Geolocation

The listings use Google geocoding to get the coords from the address field. You need to either rename .env.example to .env and add your Google Geocode API key OR in the **CreateListing.jsx** file you can set **geolocationEnabled** to "false" and it will add a lat/lng field to the form.

### Run

```bash
npm start
```
# house-marketplace
